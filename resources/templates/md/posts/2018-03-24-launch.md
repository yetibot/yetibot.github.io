Yetibot finally has a site!

Check out the [source on GitHub](https://github.com/yetibot/yetibot.github.io)
here if you're so inclined. It's powered by [Cryogen](http://cryogenweb.org/),
the Clojure-based static site generator.

One of the goals with launching the site was to have inline interactive Yetibot
examples that uses the GraphQL API on the public Yetibot instance to evaluate!
See the [User Guide](/user-guide) to check out the interactive examples in the
docs.

The site and docs are pretty bare bones but we'll improve it over time.
