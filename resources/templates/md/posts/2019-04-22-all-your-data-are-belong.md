In the last few months we've been working on including raw data in command
responses in addition to the formatted lossy-but-human-friendly derived value.

This lets us display the formatted values by default without giving up the full
data in the process, and affords the user the option of tapping into these data
using a few special commands that know how to access them.

The primary data-aware commands are:

```yetibot
!help data
```

```yetibot
!help clj
```

```yetibot
!help render
```

as well as most of the collection utilities, which simply propagate the correct
data across the pipe (i.e. do what you'd expect them to).

```yetibot
!category list collection
```

## clj

Having the data available means we can reference any piece of the shape instead
of the default human-friendly representation. One way to do this is with the
`clj` command, thanks to an awesome idea by one of our newest contributors,
[@justone](https://github.com/justone), to make the data available to `clj` (he
also contributed the `cljquote` command which we'll use to demo this idea).

```yetibot
!cljquote
```

First, let's use `data` to get at the data itself, then pass that over to `keys`
to see what's available:

```yetibot
!cljquote | data | keys
```

Then, with this information we can extract just the piece we're interested in:


```yetibot
!cljquote | clj (:clojure-quotes.core/text data)
```

Notice how `clj` can access the data from the pipe as a special var named
`data`. This puts the full power of the Clojure language at your disposal for
slicing or transforming data from commands as you see fit.

## data

The `data` command provides a way to pretty print all the data or get at a
specific subset using [json-path](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/)
syntax.

```yetibot
!help data
```

Let's peak at the data behind a Tweet:

```yetibot
!twitter display 1095377246494220288 | data show
```

And get an abbreviated view looking only at its keys:

```yetibot
!twitter display 1095377246494220288 | data | keys
```

These data represent a retweet with comment. Let's use `data` to select the
full text of the original tweet:

```yetibot
!twitter display 1095377246494220288 | data $.quoted_status.full_text
```

We could do the same with `clj` using pure Clojure functions:

```yetibot
!twitter display 1095377246494220288 | clj (get-in data [:quoted_status :full_text])
```

And if we wanted to render multiple properties of the retweet, we could combine
`data` and `render`:

```yetibot
!twitter display 1095377246494220288 | data $.quoted_status | render {{full_text}} â€“ @{{user.screen_name}} {{created_at}}
```

Between `data`, `render`, and `clj` we have multiple flexible ways to take
advantage of the data behind a pipe.

## Propagation in collections

Collection utilities are data-aware as well, so when you transform a collection
with a utility like `head`, `tail`, `random` or `grep` (among others), the data
are preserved.

```yetibot
!twitter show yetibot_chatops | random | data show
```

```yetibot
!twitter show yetibot_chatops | head 3 | data show
```

This works because there is symmetry between `:result/data` and `:result/value`,
meaning each item in the `:result/value` collection corresponds with each item
in `:result/data` or some subset of `:result/data`. This doesn't mean that
`:result/data` must be a sequential collection. Often API responses return a top
level map as the body with useful attributes like `:total-count` or other meta
data, then return the collection as an attribute of that map, e.g. `:items`. In
cases like these we don't want to give up those potentially-useful attributes,
so instead commands can return an optional `:result/collection` path key whose
value is a vector containing the path to the sequence in their response, e.g.:

```clojure
{:result/value ["red" "green" "blue"]
 :result/data {:total-count 3
               :response-ms 228
               :items [{:display-name "red"
                        :hex "#ff0000"
                        :id 1}
                       {:display-name "green"
                        :hex "#00ff00"
                        :id 2}
                       {:display-name "blue"
                        :hex "#0000ff"
                        :id 3}]}
 ;; ðŸ‘€ notice how this points into the `:result/data` structure
 :result/collection-path [:items]}
```

A few more examples demonstrating `grep` and `tail`:

```yetibot
!github repos yetibot | grep core | data show
```

```yetibot
!github repos yetibot | tail 2 | data show
```

Repeat propagates any data returned by the command it's running:

```yetibot
!github repos yetibot | repeat 2 random | data show
```

```yetibot
!repeat 3 cljquote | data show
```
