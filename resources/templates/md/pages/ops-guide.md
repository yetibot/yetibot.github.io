## Up and running

To get a Yetibot running you need:

1. Some config
1. A Postgres database
1. A way to run it (i.e. `docker` or `lein`)

Note: Yetibot runs on Java 11+. This is because Yetibot uses the Java 11 async
HTTP client. If you run Yetibot via Docker then this is already taken care of.

### Docker Compose

Docker Compose satisfies these requirements very quickly. Run from the root of
the [Yetibot repo](https://github.com/yetibot/yetibot):

```bash
docker-compose up
```

This starts up a Postgres container and a Yetibot container, configured to
connect to IRC as user name `yetibot_demo`. Once it's up check out
[http://localhost:3456](http://localhost:3456) to view the dashboard.

See the [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/yetibot/yetibot/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) file to look at exactly how
these containers are configured. This demonstrates a very minimal default config
that you can modify. For example, you could use Slack instead by switching to a
config like:

```yaml
    environment:
      - YB_ADAPTERS_SLACK_TYPE=slack
      - YB_ADAPTERS_SLACK_TOKEN=xoxb-my-token
      - YB_DB_URL=postgresql://yetibot:yetibot@postgres:5432/yetibot
```

</div>
<div class="message-body">
  For your reference, see Yetibot's
  [`Dockerfile`](https://github.com/yetibot/yetibot/blob/master/Dockerfile).

  If you decide to override the default command, make sure you activate the
  `docker` profile (e.g. `lein with-profile +docker run`) as this properly
  specifies the `.java.policy` location, which is necessary for the JVM Sandbox
  utilized by the `clj` command.

### Kubernetes with Helm

Running on Kubernetes is super simple with the official
[yetibot-helm](https://github.com/yetibot/yetibot-helm) chart.

### Minimal config

A very minimal config would be `config/config.edn`:

```clojure
{:yetibot
  {:adapters {:freenode {:type "irc",
                        :username "my-yetibot",
                        :host "chat.freenode.net",
                        :port "7070",
                        :ssl "true"}}}}
```

This instructs Yetibot to join freenode with the username `my-yetibot` (change
it to whatever you like).

If you don't configure a Postgres database, it defaults to:

```bash
postgresql://localhost:5432/yetibot
```

It expects the database to already exist, but any tables will be created
idempotently on startup. To override the default connection string along with
the above config, it'd look like:

```clojure
{:yetibot
 {:adapters {:freenode {:type "irc",
                        :username "my-yetibot",
                        :host "chat.freenode.net",
                        :port "7070",
                        :ssl "true"}}
  :db {:url "postgresql://user:pass@mydb:5432/yetibot"}}}
```

For full config see the [Configuration docs](#configuration).

### Postgres

There are many ways to install Postgres. Here we demonstrate two common
approaches:

#### Docker

As usual, Docker makes things easier when it comes to infra:

```bash

docker run -d -p 5432:5432 --name postgres \
  --restart="always" \
  -v /pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data \
  -e POSTGRES_USER="yetibot" \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD="yetibot" \
  -e POSTGRES_DB="yetibot" \
  postgres:latest

docker logs -f postgres

# to remove postgres docker container

docker rm -f postgres
```

Assuming you use a Docker link from another container to this container, the
connection string is then:

```bash
postgresql://yetibot:yetibot@postgres:5432/yetibot
```

As an example of Docker linking, you could use `psql` from another container
like:

```bash
docker run --rm -it --link postgres postgres bash
psql -h postgres -U yetibot
\l
\q
exit
```

#### Ubuntu VM

Much of this is borrowed from
[DigitalOcean's docs](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-postgresql-on-ubuntu-16-04):

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y postgresql postgresql-contrib
sudo -u postgres psql
createdb yetibot
```

### Run it

There are a few ways to quickly run a Yetibot:

1. Docker - [read the Yetibot on Docker docs](https://yetibot.com/ops-guide/#docker)
1. Grab an archive of the source from the [Yetibot releases](https://github.com/yetibot/yetibot/releases), unzip, put the config in place and `lein run`
1. Clone the source of this repo, put the config in place and `lein run`

As an example, here's how you could get the latest code from `master`, extract,
put config in place, and run it (assumes you already have
[Leiningen](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen) installed):

```bash
cd /tmp
curl https://codeload.github.com/yetibot/yetibot/tar.gz/master | tar xvz
cd yetibot-master
cat << EOF > config.edn
{:yetibot
 {:adapters
  {:freenode
   {:type "irc"
    :username "my-yetibot"
    :host "chat.freenode.net"
    :port "7070"
    :ssl "true"}}}}
EOF
YB_LOG_LEVEL=debug CONFIG_PATH=config.edn lein run
```

Once it starts up you'll see a log like:

```bash
17-05-28 23:27:56 deep.local INFO [yetibot.core.loader:41] - ‚òë Loaded 84 namespaces matching [#"^yetibot\.(core\.)?commands.*" #"^.*plugins\.commands.*"]
```

At this point it should be connected to Freenode. Trying running a command
against it:

```bash
/msg my-yetibot !echo Hello, Yetibot!
```

And you should get a reply:

```bash
my-yetibot: Hello, Yetibot!
```

## Configuration

Yetibot can be fully configured via one or more mechanisms, in order of
precedence with the first overriding the next:

- environment variables
- `leiningen` profiles EDN file
- a config EDN file

When multiple methods are specified the values are merged.

There are many configuration options in Yetibot. See sample configuration files
annotated with inline documentation in all available formats:

- [profiles.sample.clj](https://github.com/yetibot/yetibot.core/blob/master/config/profiles.sample.clj)
- [config.sample.edn](https://github.com/yetibot/yetibot.core/blob/master/config/config.sample.edn)
- [sample.env](https://github.com/yetibot/yetibot.core/blob/master/config/sample.env)

These are equivalent and both immutable (meaning they cannot change at runtime).

### Rationale

Yetibot supports both immutable and mutable configuration, for configuring
different parts of the system.

It's useful to change the configuration of a system at runtime in certain
situations. It would be burdensome to have to login to a system where Yetibot
runs, change config and restart Yetibot.

On the other hand, the benefits of immutability are well-known. Explicitly
separating out the small amount of mutable config from the majority of immutable
config lets us maximize immutability benefits and minimize negative affects of
mutability in our system.

### Modes

#### Immutable

**Immutable config sources** include both `profiles.clj` and environmental
variables via `environ` and loading EDN from a file at `config/config.edn`
(this can be overridden by specifying a `CONFIG_PATH` env var).

Any config specified in an EDN file will be overridden by values provided by
`environ`. Environment config can be explicitly ignored by setting an
environment variable `YETIBOT_ENV_CONFIG_DISABLED=true`.

Providing config via multiple methods
makes it compatible with 12-factor configuration and simple usage in container
environments while still retaining the ease of use of the EDN file option.

The majority of configurable sub-systems use immutable config as they do not
need to change very often. Examples include:

- Chat adapters
- Twitter credentials
- Postgres connection string
- etc.

#### Mutable

**All mutable config is stored in the database**.

A much smaller subset of commands need mutable config, e.g.:

- IRC channels
- Channel settings

### Prefixes

All immutable config, regardless of the source can be prefixed with either `yb`
or `yetibot`. Examples:

#### edn

```clojure
{:yetibot {:log {:level "debug"}}}
```

```clojure
{:yb {:url "yetibot.com"}}
```

#### Profile

```clojure
{:prod
 {:env
  {:yb-twitter-consumer-key "foo"}}}
```

#### Environment

```bash
YB_GIPHY_KEY="123"
YETIBOT_COMMAND_PREFIX=","
```

#### Merged result

If you decided to configure Yetibot through all available means demonstrated
above (not recommended but shown for purpose of illustration üòÖ), the merged
config data structure would be:

```clojure
{:log {:level "debug"}
 :command {:prefix ","}
 :url "yetibot.com"
 :twitter {:consumer {:key "foo"}}
 :giphy {:key "123"}}
```

Note how environment variables are exploded into nested maps. This is powered by
[dec](https://github.com/devth/dec) which you can read about in the blog post
[dec: Deep Environmental Config](https://devth.com/2018/dec-deep-environmental-config).

## Poking the runtime

Yetibot has a couple ways to poke around internal state at runtime. One is the
typical-yet-amazing practice of exposing an nREPL. The other is its built in
`eval` command. Let's take a look.

### nREPL

Yetibot exposes its [nREPL](https://nrepl.org/) on port `65432` by default.
You can override this at config path: `:nrepl :port`.

This allows you to connect your local nREPL-based tools (e.g. vim-fireplace,
CIDER, Cursive, or [many others](https://nrepl.org/nrepl/0.6.0/usage/clients.html)),
load namespaces and evaluate expressions to read or mutate state making it the
ultimate runtime debugging tool.

Some related resources:

- [Live-Debugging Remote Clojure Apps with Drawbridge](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/debugging-clojure)
  - Yetibot doesn't expose the nREPL over HTTP (though we could, and perhaps is
    not a bad idea!), but this post highlights the same idea and potential
    workflow as socket-based connections.

In addition to connecting local tools, you can simply SSH to your server and
connect to the REPL with `leiningen` like:

```bash
ssh your-server
docker exec -it yetibot sh
lein repl :connect localhost:65432
```

### Eval

Yetibot ships with a command called `eval`:

```
!help eval
```

Because it's so powerful it must be explicitly enabled per user in
configuration. This is an admin-only feature, and maybe shouldn't be enabled at
all for anyone.

<div class="message-body">
Be careful with `eval`! **It has no limits.** You can:

- mess up your Yetibot or bring it down
- destroy stuff
- expose your secrets to others in the channel
</div>
</article>

Here are some examples at poking around with eval:

```clojure
;; look at the state of the adapters
!eval (map (juxt yetibot.core.adapters.adapter/uuid yetibot.core.adapters.adapter/connected? yetibot.core.adapters.adapter/connection-latency) (yetibot.core.adapters.adapter/active-adapters))
```

## Dashboard

Yetibot runs a web server that hosts a client-side web dashboard. The dashboard
is powered by the
[yetibot-dashboard](https://github.com/yetibot/yetibot-dashboard) NPM module,
written in TypeScript. It compiles down to plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript, which
Yetibot consumes and serves as static resources. The dashboard fetches all
dynamic data from the local GraphQL API.

An example of the dashboard is hosted at
[public.yetibot.com](https://public.yetibot.com).

By default it runs on port `3003`, but you may override this by setting the
`PORT` environment variable.

## Health checks

Yetibot has a `/healthz` endpoint that should be use for heath checks. This
endpoint checks the status of all configured adapters. If any adapter reports
not being connected, `/healthz` responds `503 Service Unavailable`. Otherwise it
responds `200 OK`.

See [healthz.clj](https://github.com/yetibot/yetibot.core/blob/master/src/yetibot/core/webapp/routes/healthz.clj)
for the implementation.

## Slack auto-reconnect

When a Slack connection is closed, we automatically try to reconnect with
exponential back-off, up to 500 times. This usually works to restore the
connection eventually unless there is a prolonged network outage and all 500
reconnect attempts are spent.

While a connection is open, we try to keep it open by sending `ping` event every
10 seconds, and expect a `pong` back within 5 seconds, as recommended in the
[Slack RTM docs](https://api.slack.com/rtm). If we fail to get a `pong` back
within those 5 seconds, the connection is then marked in-active, causing the
above `/healthz` endpoint to report `503`.
