* Yetibot Site

** Prerequisites

-  Install [[https://github.com/boot-clj/boot][boot]]

** Usage

Run =boot dev=.

This will start a web server on port 3000, watch the directory and
rebuild the target on changes.

On =git push= gitlab ci takes care of deployment.

*** REPL driven development

Alternatively to running =boot dev=, run =boot repl=, then connect to
the REPL from Emacs (=C-c M-c=), open the =build.boot= file, eval the
buffer (=C-c C-k=) and then run =(boot (boot.user/dev))=.


*** Initial setup

- Add :base-url to global-meta data

** SEO

We are using [[https://schema.org][schema.org]] markup to add some SEO juice. When adding new
structured data, test it out on [[https://search.google.com/structured-data/testing-tool][Googles Structured Testing Tool]]. Find
out more about structured data on Googles [[https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/intro-structured-data][Introduction to Structured Data]] article.

** Publish Guideline

*** Posts

1. Create a new .md file within /posts
2. Add required meta data for
   - uuid (generate one with =uuidgen=)
   - title
   - category
     - Note: Categories are also used in navigation. They define the
       'main interests' on our blog. Therefore it's not bad if we
       regularly come back to the same categories. The category is
       also our "focus keyword" for the post.
   - tags
     - Use as many as you like. They help with SEO.
     - At the moment, tags and category will be merged as "keywords"
       for SEO. Do not repeat the category within the tags, because
       there is no 'unique' filter atm.
   - date-created (Format YYYY-MM-DD)

**** Checks

- If you used a new Category within your Post, make sure to also link
  it in the [[file:src/ok/index.clj][index.clj]] layout.

** Convert Images (with Image Magick)

*** Scale

=convert phil.jpg -resize 980x980^ -gravity Center -extent 980x980 phil2.jpg=

*** Color

- [ ] A light sepia would be better

=convert savino_bak.jpg -set colorspace Gray -separate -average savino.jpg=

** Generate a Word Cloud

see https://www.jasondavies.com/wordcloud/

Here is a word list to get started with

Clojure
ClojureScript
Reagent
Figwheel
re-frame
ReactNative
re-natal
Hiccup
Compjure
CompojureAPI
Garden
Selmer
Luminus
Ring
hugsql

TODO generate the wordlist from project metadata

** TODOs


*** TODO Add favicon through realfavicongenerator
*** TODO Some technologies in =technologies.yml= are only stubs
*** TODO Some technology links on project pages might not resolve, because for example fsbd is not a technology, but a project
*** TODO Style Opensource page and source in some logic from =project.clj=
*** TODO Eval how to do a 404 Page

- [ ] Is it even possible without a back-end?

The only thing I'd change is that `permalink` and `canonical-url` are no longer necessary - resolution of those keys are automatic now.

*** TODO Eval options for paginating the blog
*** TODO When rendering the blog preview, properly close the missing tags
- [ ] Maybe use an HTML parser and close the tags
- [ ] Maybe use a completely different option for previews
*** TODO Optimize page on Google speedtest
Optimise yetibot.github.io on Google Speed Test

https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fyetibot.github.io&tab=mobile

*** TODO Use schema.org markup for other pages than the blog
*** TODO Upgrade to new Perun version

- [ ] =permalink= and =canonical-url= are no longer necessary - resolution of those keys are automatic now

*** TODO Implement tags

- [X] There is now a =tags= task in Perun
